This folder contains certificates which will be used for certificate pinning. Per [`cordova-plugin-advanced-http` documentation](https://github.com/silkimen/cordova-plugin-advanced-http#setservertrustmode), these need to be encoded in DER format.

`origin.crt` is pulled from Cloudflare's servers hosting api.netrix.io.
