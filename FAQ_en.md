# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why are my grade notifications delayed?
The server syncs user data every half an hour (1800 seconds) to ~1.6 hours (6000 seconds). The reason for a delay this long is that too many requests in a short timespan puts a lot of stress on Netrix and CARNet's servers.

Of course, this timespan may change depending on the number of users, holidays or the start/end of a school year.

## Why is the app in [language]?
The app adjusts the lanugage of the interface according to the device language. Supported languages are Croatian, English and German. If the device is in another language, it defaults to Croatian.

## What causes the old data warning when I open the app?
This warning is shown when the app is unable to connect with the server. Possible reasons can be:
* **Unavailable network** - WLAN or mobile data is disabled or unusable
* **Insecure connection** - the server's certificate is invalid; usually because the device isn't logged in to a public WLAN
* **Server-side error** - a temporary issue processing data
